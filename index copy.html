									  <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text">Nobel laureate in literature Abdulrazak Gurnah captivated Princeton audiences in an Oct. 30 visit with reflections on literature, compassion and the “oceanic cosmopolitanism” that connects artists and thinkers across continents. 
										<br>
										Gurnah was born in Zanzibar, Tanzania, and is professor of English and postcolonial literatures, emeritus, at the University of Kent in England. When he was a child in the 1950s, “travelers would come from different parts of the ocean to our island with their goods and stories,” Gurnah told a rapt audience of students, faculty members, staff and community members that packed Arthur Lewis Auditorium. “I grew up with the stories they brought.

										<br>
										“Every year the world came to us, then went away when the currents and the winds changed, leaving something behind, not the least of which was a greater knowledge of human multiplicity,” Gurnah said. “I have written and spoken about this phenomenon and its tremendous impact in understanding a connection with the wider world.”
										<br>
										Gurnah’s acclaimed novels include “Memory of Departure,” “Pilgrims Way,” “Dottie,” “Paradise,” “By the Sea” and “Afterlives.” He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 2021(Link is external) “for his uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents.” His Princeton talk was presented in conversation with Simon Gikandi, the Class of 1943 University Professor of English.
										<br>
										Gurnah told the Princeton audience that as a schoolboy, he was given abridged versions of British and American books in English to read: Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Kidnapped,” Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities,” an illustrated copy of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,” Mark Twain’s “Tom Sawyer.”
										<br>
										“We were colonized by the British and our education was a colonial one,” he said. Literature brought him a kind of refuge during the violence of the 1964 revolution in Zanzibar — but it was the radio that introduced him to the African novel.
										<br>
										As a teenager during the revolution, “I remember sitting in one of the small rooms in our house because the small room felt safer when there were sounds of bullets going on somewhere,” Gurnah said. “I remember listening to the BBC World Service with my aunt when I heard an interview and then a reading from a new book by a Kenyan writer. The book was called ‘Weep Not, Child,’ and the writer’s name was Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o.”
										<br>
										When he and his brother left for Canterbury, England, to escape the violence, his newfound discovery of writers from East Africa became an essential tether to the family home he left behind. “I found I had brought my home with me and that I had to learn to live with it in this unfamiliar place that was now also to become my home,” he said. “I made my way as best as I could in pursuit of what I valued and aspire to do, which was to be a scholar of literature.”
										<br>
										While pursuing his Ph.D. at Kent, Gurnah noticed that the African works of fiction he studied didn’t speak to his particular experience of time and place. “Part of my motivation for writing was to fill that gap,” he said. “It might seem that the writer chooses his or her subject, but I suspect that more often than not the subject chooses him or her.”
										<br>
										Gurnah said writing fiction has enabled him to depict “another idea of belonging, which frees itself from a polarized vision of the world.” This oceanic cosmopolitanism, as he calls it, recognizes how the ocean connects everyone and illuminates the “qualities which make us human.”
